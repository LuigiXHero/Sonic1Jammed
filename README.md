# Sonic1Jammed
Sonic 1 with jam layouts and features wrapped up in a nice options menu

The Main features:
- includes Revision 00, Revision 01, Easy and Original Layouts.
(Original is just Revision 01 but with a fix to prevent jumping over the level in SLZ2.)

- Can enable or disable the level order for easy mode separately from Easy mode itself.
(Easy mode has files for every level, unsure if they're different from normal I never checked)

- Can enable or disable the spindash
- Same with Time Overs
- switch bug behavior between original and Jam's (or S2 I guess)
