Because several file formats used in the disassembly are incompatible with SonLVL, some data may be stored locally within this folder.

The following data is pulled from the disassembly itself. Any changes made to the disassembly or by SonLVL will be reflected in both.
* Level layouts
* 256x256 mappings
* 16x16 mappings
* Level graphics
* Sprite graphics
* Collision

The following data is stored locally in this folder. Any changes made to the disassembly will not be reflected in SonLVL, and likewise changes made by SonLVL will not appear in the disassembly.
* Object positions
* Start positions
* Sprite mappings

In order to get object position data edited by SonLVL to show up in the disassembly, run the "COPY TO DISASM" batch file in this folder. This will overwrite files in the "Object Placement" folder with data from SonLVL.
